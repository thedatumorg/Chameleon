Time-series anomaly detection is widely applied across domains, where reliable and timely detection of outliers is critical for real-world decision making. Yet existing benchmarks on standalone detectors consistently highlight the absence of a one-size-fits-all model, motivating the development of automated solutions that reduce reliance on expert-driven selection and cumbersome tuning. However, this remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data as well as the heterogeneity of time series and anomaly types. Current approaches remain limited: some are confined to univariate settings, scalable methods often fail under distribution shift, and the most reliable solutions incur substantial computational overhead. We propose Chameleon, a reliable and efficient automated system for time-series anomaly detection, comprising a recommender that estimates candidate rankings and an optimizer that refines these rankings and ensembles for improved robustness. In the recommender stage, Chameleon introduces anomaly–residual decomposition and input adaptation with a neural selector to rank candidate detectors for time series of varying lengths and variates. Then in the optimizer stage, Chameleon performs anomaly-specific test-time adaptation via synthetic anomaly injection for pseudo-supervised re-ranking, followed by a weighted ensemble to improve robustness beyond single-model predictions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across time series from nine domains using rigorous statistical analysis. Chameleon outperforms 12 state-of-the-art automated solutions under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Notably, Chameleon is the first solution to match the performance of supervised model selection per dataset. In terms of scalability, Chameleon achieves up to 140x speedup over the previous most reliable strategy and maintains efficiency as time-series length increases, establishing it as both the most effective and efficient automated solution for time-series anomaly detection.
